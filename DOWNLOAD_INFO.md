# Music Download Feature

## Overview
This app now supports downloading music from your Subsonic/Navidrome/Gonic/AirSonic server directly to your Garmin watch instead of streaming.

## How It Works

### 1. Configuration
Configure your server settings in the **Garmin Connect Mobile App**:
- Open Garmin Connect Mobile
- Go to Device Settings for your watch
- Find "yumusic" app
- Enter your:
  - **Server URL**: Full URL including port (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:4533`)
  - **Username**: Your server username
  - **Password**: Your server password

### 2. Sync Music
Once configured, you can download music:
1. On your watch, open the yumusic app
2. Select "Sync" from the menu
3. The app will download songs from your server
4. Downloaded music is stored locally on the watch

### 3. Playback
After syncing:
1. Select "Playback" from the menu
2. Choose music source (Random Songs, Playlists, etc.)
3. Music plays from downloaded files, not streamed

## Features
- **Pure Black Dark Theme** with orange accents optimized for AMOLED displays
- **Round display optimization** for 416x416 screens (Venu 2)
- **Download management** with progress tracking
- **Offline playback** - no internet needed after download
- **Scrobbling support** - tracks are marked as played on your server

## Storage Considerations
- Downloaded music takes up storage on your watch
- Manage downloads carefully based on available space
- Only sync playlists or songs you need

## Troubleshooting
- If connection fails, verify your server URL is correct and accessible from your phone's network
- Ensure your watch is connected to WiFi or your phone for initial downloads
- Check that your server credentials are correct in Garmin Connect Mobile
